# 🌤️ Weather Forecaster - ASP.NET MVC Web Application

**Weather Forecaster** is a real-time weather display web application built using **ASP.NET MVC** and powered by the [WeatherAPI.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/). Developed as part of my **Programming 3A module** in the final year of my degree, this project demonstrates practical integration of RESTful APIs into full-stack .NET web applications.

The application helps users, especially travelers, view accurate, up-to-date weather conditions and a six-day forecast for any location worldwide.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The Weather Forecaster application enhances the travel booking experience by giving users critical weather insights before they plan their trips. The web app fetches data from the Weather API and presents it in a clear, user-friendly interface. This real-time access to weather updates solves a core user need: knowing the conditions of a travel destination before departure.
